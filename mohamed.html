            <div class="paragraphs">
                <p id="1">On 05/15/2023 at 9:59 pm, our conversation began, and I do not know how much of my dream I lost in exchange for having my nose broken, but because of my broken nose, I gained the best love I have ever had, so her first words were a comment on my story, ‚ÄúCongratulations, you had plastic surgery.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="2">I don't know what happened at that time, but all I know is that I stayed on her chat to talk to her about my suffering with a broken nose and the difficulty of talking. We talked about how much I love my friends to be by my side, and from here the topic changed completely.</p>
                <p id="3">I started talking to her about the dangers of social media, and I was describing it to herself, and she was attracted to my words and everything. While I was talking to her, I never left!! She was in high school, and I preferred to support her and stay by her side a lot. I talked to her, arranged her schedule, and got her opinion on many matters! And she talked and talked and talked until she had the passion to know who she was born with. what have you done to me? Did you really love her? Do I really miss her every day? Am I really jealous to her? The answer I foolishly found was</p><b><q>Yes</q></b>
                <p id="4">but passion was not born in her, and I knew that she was in love with another person, and I was at the height of my sadness and happiness, my sadness to see her with someone other than me, and my happiness to see how happy she is with this other person.</p>
                <p id="5">Days passed, and we were talking passionately about each other and getting closer and closer until she said to me, ‚ÄúWithout Yasta.‚Äù She was really jealous of me, how much I loved this sentence! Really, how much I related to her! But she was preventing jealousy because she would get hurt.. Yes, I was very affected, but I had nothing I could do, as she was in love with someone else! We talked a lot about jealousy...we really talked about a lot of things...the first discussion between us was serious! He was..</p>
                <p id="6">It was a topic of distance from each other. We decided to stay away from each other for any reason!! For a really trivial reason, how fanatical I am to this day! It was because of me! I don't want to talk to girls. It was a valid reason, but I couldn't have talked to her, and yet I made this stupid decision! Indeed, after some time passed, I discovered that she was talking to boys. This really made me angry! I still love you, as you see! This was the beginning of our discussion about how to do this. We decided to stay away, you and I, and we will not speak to anyone again. What are you doing!! There was a quarrel between us, and this is the first quarrel!! Days passed and we got back together and talked a lot as usual, but she didn't want that! Because of her love for the other person, she wanted to stay away from me because of some trivial barriers!! We preferred to quarrel because of this, and we were distant and close, and distant and close, but I was the selfish one! I wanted her to myself at any cost. I wanted to talk to her at any cost....</p>
                <p id="7">I did not realize my words while I was doing that, but I was playing the role of the victim in order to talk to her again..! I am truly sorry, so forgive me, my princess!! Days passed and we talked and discussed the topic of distance and barriers and kept our distance, and I tended to play the victim, but this was against me, my princess, so I really love you! How mentally ill I am because of my obsession with you! Now we are no longer together again, but how much I miss you and how much I want to talk to you!!</p>
